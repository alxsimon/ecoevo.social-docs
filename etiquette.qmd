## Use of Content Warnings

Content Warnings (CW) are useful to
1) protect people sensitive to a given subject from being unwillingly exposed to it,
2) keep subjects that may not interest everyone an opt-in option
and/or 3) keep timelines easier to read.

CW should be used for subjects such as:

* Trigerring content: such as reports or news about sexual assault, harassment, violence, racism, LGBTQIA+-phobia, burn-out.
* Glorification of over-working
* Politics
* Job postings: you can use the subject area as you would in an email `Subject`


## Use of hashtags

Hashtags is how content can be discovered on Mastodon.
Text in toots is not searched (in most cases anyway, it requires additional algorithms to do so).

Knowing that, we encourage the use of hashtags to classify more easily the content you share.

Hashtags should use the CamelCase format, where words are separated by upper cases, like so: `#ThisNewHashtagIsGreat`.

A list of hashtags that could be used on [ecoevo.social](https://ecoevo.social):

* `#JobOffer` when posting a job offer of any kind, add more hashtags to precise level
	`#TenureTrack`, `#Postdoc`, `#GraduateStudent`, `#Technician`, etc. and 
	subjects `#Ecology`, `#Labwork`, `#Modeling`, etc.
* `#Intership` to advertise an internship, precise subjects similar to job offers.
* `#Conference` to advertise a conference.
* ...


## Threads

When posting a thread:

1. Set your first toot to be **Public** (visible for all)
2. Answer your first toot and set the visibility to **Unlisted** (Visible for all, but opted-out of discovery features)
3. Continue your thread and the visibility will be automatically continued as Unlisted

It is nice to use the `i/n` indication at the end of your toots to better indicate this is a thread,
where i in the current toot and n is the total number of toots (you can keep it as a litteral n if you don't know the total number of toots).
Well you know how to do it if you come from the bird site.
