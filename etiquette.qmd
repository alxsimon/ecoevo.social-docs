## Use of Content Warnings

Content Warnings (CW) are useful to:

1) protect people sensitive to a given subject from being unwillingly exposed to it,
2) keep subjects that may not interest everyone an opt-in option, and/or 
3) keep timelines easier to read.

Content Warnings should be used for topics including, but not limited to:

* Triggering content
	* reports or news about sexual assault, harassment, violence, racism, LGBTQIA+-phobia, burnout, etc.
* Glorification of over-working
* Politics
* Job postings: you can use the subject area as you would in an email `Subject`

## Describe the media you post

Description of photos and videos you post are really important
to increase the accessibility of Mastodon to visually impaired people.

When posting a media, click the edit button and
a window will allow you to enter a description.

## Use of hashtags

Hashtags are how content from users you do not follow can be discovered on Mastodon, since the text content of toots
is generally not searchable (in most cases anyway; in all cases it requires additional algorithms/software/infrastructure to do so).

Given that consideration, we encourage the use of hashtags to classify and broaden the potential reach of the content you share.

Hashtags should use the CamelCase format, where words are separated by upper cases, like so: `#ThisNewHashtagIsGreat`.
This can aid in their readability both by people and by screen readers.

A list of hashtags that could be used on [ecoevo.social](https://ecoevo.social):

* `#JobOffer` when posting a job offer of any kind, add more hashtags to precise level
	`#TenureTrack`, `#Postdoc`, `#GraduateStudent`, `#Technician`, etc. and 
	subjects `#Ecology`, `#Labwork`, `#Modeling`, etc.
* `#Internship` to advertise an internship, precise subjects similar to job offers
* `#Conference` to advertise a conference
* `#Preprint`, `#JournalArticle`, etc. for new research results
* `#rstats` or `#python` or other languages for coding questions or resources

## Threads

When posting a thread:

1. Set your first toot to be **Public** (visible for all)
2. Then, reply to your first toot and set the visibility to **Unlisted** (visible for all, but opted-out of discovery features)
3. Continue your thread and the visibility will be automatically continue to be set as Unlisted unless you change it

It is considerate to use the `i/n` indication at the end of your toots to better indicate this is a thread,
where `i` is the number of the current toot in the thread and `n` is the total number of toots. You can keep it as a
literal `n` if you don't know the total number of toots). This approach is similar to the convetion people use at the bird site.
