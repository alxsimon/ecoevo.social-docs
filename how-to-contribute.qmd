## Contributing to this documentation

This is a quarto book hosted on github.

To contribute, head to the github repository and open either
an [issue](https://github.com/alxsimon/ecoevo.social-docs/issues),
a [pull-request](https://github.com/alxsimon/ecoevo.social-docs/pulls)
or a [discussion](https://github.com/alxsimon/ecoevo.social-docs/discussions).

Documents are written in markdown, and content are in the `./*.qmd` documents.

## Contributing financially

If you want to contribute financially to server hosting costs,
head to [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/ecoevosocial).
The budget is fully transparent there.


We are not there yet, but in case more money than necessary is collected, it will be redistributed to the community.
This could take a lot of forms, such as "best student science communication toot" competition and prize?

## Helping moderating

If you want to help protect people from this instance against external and internal misbehaviors,
