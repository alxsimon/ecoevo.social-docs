# Introduction to ecoevo.social

**Rules to respect, etiquette and general things to know about the 
[ecoevo.social](https://ecoevo.social/) server and [Mastodon](#what-is-mastodon) in general.**

[ecoevo.social](https://ecoevo.social/) is a Mastodon server dedicated to the biological Ecology and Evolution community.
This is broadly defined; everyone who is connected to those topics is welcome.

[ecoevo.social](https://ecoevo.social/) is administered by [Alexis Simon](https://ecoevo.social/@alxsim).
This is volunteer work, and as such there may occasionally be some issues along the road that are not resolved immediately.
Please be patient if issues arise, as we are all learning together how to best develop this community and space.

If you are in a position to do so, you can contribute financially for the maintenance of the server
through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/ecoevosocial).

Enjoy connecting!

## Important considerations about privacy

Posts on Mastodon are not end-to-end encrypted. Do not share any sensitive information over Mastodon.
For more details, see the [privacy policy](https://ecoevo.social/terms).

You must be aware that Mastodon data, both public and direct messages,
are accessible by server operators and receiving servers 
(for example if you send a direct message to someone on another server).

Quoted from the [privacy policy](https://ecoevo.social/terms):

> We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply
> with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect our or others' rights, property, or safety.

If you need to have truly private conversations with someone else that contain sensitive information,
we suggest you use another application offering end-to-end encryption and privacy. One good option is [Signal](https://signal.org).
