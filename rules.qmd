title: Rules

Rules you accept to adhere to when using ecoevo.social:

1. No racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, or casteism
2. No incitement of violence or promotion of violent ideologies
3. No harassment, dogpiling or doxxing of other users
4. Do not share intentionally false or misleading information
5. No sexually explicit or violent media posting
6. No content illegal in France and Germany

This set of rules has been copied from the mastodon.social instance.
They are not set in stone and I encorage the community offering changes in wording or adding rules.
