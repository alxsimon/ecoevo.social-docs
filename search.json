Do not share any sensitive information over Mastodon. For more details, see the privacy policy.\nYou must be aware that Mastodon data, both public and direct messages, are accessible by server operators and receiving servers (for example if you send a direct message to someone on another server).\nQuoted from the privacy policy:\n\nWe may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect our or others’ rights, property, or safety.\n\nIf you need to have truly private conversations with someone else that contain sensitive information, we suggest you use another application offering end-to-end encryption and privacy. One good option is Signal."

This can aid in their readability both by people and by screen readers.\nA list of hashtags that could be used on ecoevo.social:\n\n#JobOffer when posting a job offer of any kind, add more hashtags to precise level #TenureTrack, #Postdoc, #GraduateStudent, #Technician, etc. and subjects #Ecology, #Labwork, #Modeling, etc.\n#Internship to advertise an internship, precise subjects similar to job offers\n#Conference to advertise a conference\n#Preprint, #JournalArticle, etc. for new research results\n#rstats or #python or other languages for coding questions or resources"

You can keep it as a literal n if you don’t know the total number of toots. This approach is similar to the convention people use at the bird site."
