This is broadly defined; everyone who is connected to those topics is welcome.\necoevo.social is administered by Alexis Simon. This is volunteer work, and as such there may occasionally be some issues along the road that are not resolved immediately. Please be patient if issues arise, as we are all learning together how to best develop this community and space.\nIf you are in a position to do so, you can contribute financially for the maintenance of the server through Open Collective.\nThe infrastucture of ecoevo.social is maintained by masto.host and physically hosted by OVH in France. Their terms of service can be found here. Status of the server can be seen here, ecoevo.social is hosted on App Server 9 and Database 8.\nEnjoy connecting!"

Do not share any sensitive information over Mastodon. For more details, see the privacy policy.\nYou must be aware that Mastodon data, both public and direct messages, are accessible by server operators and receiving servers (for example if you send a direct message to someone on another server).\nQuoted from the privacy policy:\n\nWe may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect our or others’ rights, property, or safety.\n\nIf you need to have truly private conversations with someone else that contain sensitive information, we suggest you use another application offering end-to-end encryption and privacy.

If a disaster restore is needed, over 24 hours of data could be missing, and it could take several days to bring the service back online.\n\n\nAs mentioned on the my.masto.host backup page, you should regularly download the backup of your server as backups are not stored offline, and in the event of a catastrophic failure, your copy of the backups may be the only way to restore the server. Masto.host is in open beta and offered with no warranty.\n\nAs masto.host does not offer a third off-site backup at this time, the admin will manually download the database backup as regurlarly as possible. This backup is stored privately and encrypted on a remote AWS S3 server. Manual backups will not include media posted on the instance.\nPlease be aware that in case of catastrophic server failure, more than 24h of data and all media could be lost."

Users of [ecoevo.social] are expected to have the literacy to understand that”reverse discrimination” is not real, and so attempts to re-centre discussions of marginalized people around the feelings of the privileged will be taken as manipulative behaviour undertaken deliberately in bad-faith. (E.g. white people should not demand that people of colour put CW’s on every discussion of race; a straight person who reports a queer person for writing “I hate straight people” may find their own account suspended.)”\n\n\n\nThese rules are not set in stone and community-suggested changes in wording or the addition of rules is welcomed. See the section How to contribute.\nIn addition to the community guidelines we put in place, the hosting service we are using, masto.host, has its own terms of service as well.

CW are useful to:\n\nEmpower readers who are sensitive to particular subjects to actively decide when to engage with those subjects,\nkeep subjects that may not interest everyone as an opt-in option, and/or\nkeep timelines easier to read.\n\nContent Warnings should be used for topics including, but not limited to:\n\nTriggering content\n\nreports or news about sexual assault, harassment, violence, racism, antisemitism, LGBTQIA+-phobia, burnout, etc.\n\nGlorification of over-working\nCommon phobia-triggering animal media (e.g. spiders, snakes, sharks).\n\nCWs are a useful tool for managing your content. You can use CWs when posting about material you think might not be of broad interest or might take too much visual space. For example, job postings will primarily be of interest to folks looking for that particular job, so you could use a CW to give the general job type/title and let interested readers expand the post to see more details (see also use of hashtags).\nIn this context it can be helpful to think of CW as representing “Content Wrap” rather than Content Warning.\nPlease also read Regarding attempts to abuse these anti-abuse tools and policies."

This can aid in their readability both by people and by screen readers.\nA list of hashtags that could be used on ecoevo.social:\n\n#JobOffer when posting a job offer of any kind, add more hashtags to precise level #Faculty, #Postdoc, #PhdPosition, #Technician, etc.; and subjects such as #Ecology, #Labwork, or #Modeling. See Job postings section.\n#Internship to advertise an internship, precise subjects similar to job offers\n#Conference to advertise a conference\nNewPaper or #Preprint for new research results\n#rstats or #python or other languages for coding questions or resources"

Instead, a new account is created on the new server and Mastodon make it easy to export/import the followed account list and followers from the old server to the new one.\n\n\nHere are the steps to migrate.\nA) On the new server ecoevo.social:\n\nOpen a new account on ecoevo.social with the username you want (it does not have to be the same one as on mastodon.social)\nSet up your profile on your new account, such as displayed name, profile picture, and bio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB) On the old server mastodon.social:\n\nGo to Preferences > Import and export > Data export and export in CSV format every category you wish to transfer to the ecoevo.social server. \n\nC) On the new server ecoevo.social:\n\nGo to Preferences > Import and export > Import and import back the CSV files for each category of data you want. \nGo to Preferences > Account > Account settings and in the section “Moving from a different account” click on “create an account alias” link. You need to alias your two accounts, this is necessary for the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD) On the old server mastodon.social:\nGo to Preferences > Account > Account settings and in the section “Move to a different account” click on “configure it here” link. On this page you will indicate your new account handle (with your new server) such as TootJedi@ecoevo.social and your password for this new account on ecoevo.social.\n\n\nOnce this is all finished, your followers will be transfered to your new account (i.e. a follower will automatically unfollow your old account and follow your new account). This operation can take a few minutes or several hours to complete, depending on the computational load of servers. A redirection has been put in place on your old account.\nAs a final step, when you have checked that all your followers and followed account, lists, muted, and/or blocked accounts have been correctly transfered, you can delete your old account. Head to your old account settings on mastodon.social in Preferences > Account > Account settings, at the bottom of the page in the section “Delete account” click on the “proceed here” link. Please be aware that account deletion is irreversible and will condemn your handle from ever being used again."
