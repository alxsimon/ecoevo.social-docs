We've gathered a few useful tips and handy 
[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) features
to improve your experience.

## Finding your network

Whether you are migrating from Twitter or not,
here is a list of useful tools that can help you find people you
would like to connect with.

* Finding people by topic:
	* [fediverse.info](https://fediverse.info/explore/people)
	* [fedi.directory](https://fedi.directory/)
	* [trunk](https://communitywiki.org/trunk)
* Use your Twitter information to search for people on Mastodon:
	* [fedifinder](https://fedifinder.glitch.me/)
	* [debirdify](https://pruvisto.org/debirdify/)
	* [twitodon](https://twitodon.com/)

You can also use [Guppe groups](https://a.gup.pe/) to follow posts from whole groups of people.
Briefly, you can follow a topic group account and post to this group by @'ing the group account.
