We've gathered a few useful tips and handy 
[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) features
to improve your experience.

## Migrating your account

Let's say for example you want to migrate from
*mastodon.social* (your old server) to *ecoevo.social* (your new server).

::: {.callout-note}
An account is not really "moved" from one server to another.
Instead, a new account is created on the new server and Mastodon make
it easy to export/import the followed account list and followers from the old
server to the new one.
:::

Here are the steps to migrate.

**A) On the new server *ecoevo.social*:**

1) Open a new account on *ecoevo.social* with the username you want
(it does not have to be the same one as on *mastodon.social*)
2) Set up your profile on your new account, such as displayed name,
profile picture, and bio.

**B) On the old server *mastodon.social*:**

1) Go to `Preferences > Import and export > Data export` and export in CSV format
every category you wish to transfer to the *ecoevo.social* server.<br>

**C) On the new server *ecoevo.social*:**

1) Go to `Preferences > Import and export > Import` and import back the CSV files
for each category of data you want.<br>

2) Go to `Preferences > Account > Account settings` and in the section
"Moving from a different account" click on "create an account alias" link.
You need to alias your two accounts, this is necessary for the next step.

**D) On the old server *mastodon.social*:**

Go to `Preferences > Account > Account settings` and in the section
"Move to a different account" click on "configure it here" link.
On this page you will indicate your new account handle (with your new server)
such as `TootJedi@ecoevo.social` and your password for this new account on
*ecoevo.social*.

Once this is all finished, your followers will be transfered to your new account
(i.e. a follower will automatically unfollow your old account and follow your new account).
This operation can take a few minutes or several hours to complete,
depending on the computational load of servers.
A redirection has been put in place on your old account.

As a final step, when you have checked that all your followers and followed account,
lists, muted, and/or blocked accounts have been correctly transfered, you can delete your old account.
Head to your old account settings on *mastodon.social* in `Preferences > Account > Account settings`,
at the bottom of the page in the section "Delete account" click on the "proceed here" link.
Please be aware that account deletion is irreversible and will condemn your handle from ever
being used again.
